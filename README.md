Task - Conference Ticket Generator
You will build and host a Conference Ticket Generator using React or any React Framework (e.g., Next.js, etc.). The ticket generator will allow users to fill out a form with their details, perform validations on the inputs, and generate a ticket upon successful submission.
Note: Only React or any React Framework is allowed.
Core Features
Form Elements:
Full Name: Text input for the user's full name.
Email Address: Email input field.
Avatar Upload: Users should upload their avatar image and store it using Cloudinary or any image hosting service. The form should only accept and submit the image URL.
Submit Button: Button to submit the form.
Form Validation:
Ensure all required fields are filled in before submission.
The email should have a valid format.
The avatar upload should accept Cloudinary URLs or any image link.
Provide clear error messages near the respective field if validation fails.
State Persistence
The form should retain user inputs using IndexedDB or local storage so that the data is not lost on page refresh.
Accessibility
Ensure all form fields, hints, and error messages are screen-reader accessible.
All elements must be focusable, with clear hover and focus states.
Users must be able to navigate the form and submit it using only the keyboard.
Ticket Generation
On successful submission, generate and display a Conference Ticket containing:
Full Name
Email Address
Avatar (displayed as an image from the provided URL)
The ticket should only be generated if the form passes validation.
Responsive Design
Ensure the form and ticket layout adjust seamlessly across different screen sizes .
Optimize for small screens with proper spacing and stacking.
